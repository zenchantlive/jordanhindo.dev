# Building Catwalk Live: An AI-Orchestrated Development Journey

**A 7-part blog series documenting the complete development of Catwalk Live - a production MCP deployment platform built entirely through AI orchestration. Zero lines manually coded.**

---

## 📖 Series Overview

This blog series chronicles the real, unfiltered journey of building a production-ready platform from December 11-23, 2025, using only AI coding assistants. No traditional manual coding - everything generated through strategic AI orchestration.

**The Result**: A fully functional, production-deployed platform that transforms local-only MCP servers into remote HTTP endpoints, complete with:
- 4,400 lines of production code (Python + TypeScript)
- 87% test coverage
- Security hardening (multi-agent reviewed)
- Live deployment on Fly.io and Vercel
- Open source under MIT license

**The Methodology**: A reproducible framework for building complex systems with AI, including where AI excels, where it struggles, and how to orchestrate effectively.

**The Lessons**: Honest insights into the skill shift from "code writer" to "AI orchestrator" - what worked, what failed, and what the future holds.

## 📚 Read the Series

### [Part 1: Genesis - Choosing AI-First Development](01-genesis-choosing-ai-first.md)
**Date**: December 11, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 8 min

The decision to build entirely with AI. The MCP distribution problem. First commits and early lessons in prompting. Learning that specificity matters more than you think.

**Key Insights**:
- Why AI orchestration instead of traditional coding
- The importance of structured prompts with constraints
- Creating AGENTS.md as "external memory" for AI
- Validating everything - never trust blindly

**Commits**: `215deaa` → `4d6b32b`

### [Part 2: Foundation - The First 48 Hours](02-foundation-first-48-hours.md)
**Date**: December 11-12, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 10 min

Multi-AI planning session (Claude vs GPT-4 vs Gemini). Building Aurora UI. Dynamic form generation emerges. Creating the context/ structure that became critical.

**Key Insights**:
- Cross-validating architecture across different AI models
- PostgreSQL driver debate (asyncpg vs psycopg3)
- Why context files prevent "AI amnesia"
- The first "wow" moment - adaptive forms working

**Commits**: `f5a957a` → `af021a1`

---

### [Part 3: Production Baptism - Fly.io Reality Check](03-production-baptism-flyio.md)
**Date**: December 12-14, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 12 min

First production deployment. PostgreSQL driver nightmare. Docker CRLF hell. Missing dependencies cascade. Fly.io Postgres cluster breakdown. MCP Streamable HTTP implementation. Victory: Claude Desktop connects end-to-end.

**Key Insights**:
- Infrastructure quirks AI can't predict (Fly.io SSL parameters)
- Environment differences (Windows CRLF vs Linux LF)
- Dependency management failures
- Where AI excelled: HTTP patterns, API proxying
- Where AI struggled: vendor-specific infrastructure

**Commits**: `5d1fb9f` → `768d0b3`

---

### [Part 4: The Pivot - From SaaS to Open Source](04-pivot-saas-to-open-source.md)
**Date**: December 19-20, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 9 min

Strategic decision: Why SaaS monetization didn't make sense. Glama registry integration (12K+ MCP servers). Settings UI becomes Phase 0 priority. Roadmap complete revision. Documentation becomes as important as code.

**Key Insights**:
- Validating market before building features
- How pivots require updating AI context files
- Concurrency bugs AI missed (registry cache race condition)
- Open source removes adoption friction

**Commits**: `7c2fa06` → `50c56b4`

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### What AI Did Exceptionally Well (95%+ Success Rate)
- ✅ Boilerplate and patterns (FastAPI routes, React components)
- ✅ Testing (51 tests generated, 90% worked first try)
- ✅ Documentation structure (README, API docs)
- ✅ Refactoring (extract functions, rename variables)
- ✅ Type definitions (TypeScript interfaces, Pydantic schemas)

### What Required Heavy Human Intervention (20-40% Success Rate)
- ❌ Infrastructure-specific quirks (Fly.io SSL, PostgreSQL drivers)
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities (command injection, credential leaks)
- ❌ Cross-system integration (NextAuth ↔ PostgreSQL sync)
- ❌ Environment configuration (secret mismatches, timing issues)
- ❌ Production debugging (log interpretation, infrastructure failures)

### The Pattern
**AI excels when**: Problem is well-documented, pattern exists in training data, environment is standard

**AI struggles when**: Infrastructure has quirks, security requires adversarial thinking, debugging needs domain expertise

**Your role**: Architect, reviewer, debugger, validator, security thinker

## 📖 The Reproducible Methodology

**Phase 1: Foundation**
1. Create context structure (AGENTS.md, context/ directory)
2. Write structured prompts with constraints
3. Multi-AI cross-validation (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)

**Phase 2: Implementation**
4. Phase-based development (one phase per session)
5. Generate code with explicit quality requirements
6. Immediate validation (linters, tests, type checking)

**Phase 3: Quality Control**
7. Multi-agent code review (CodeRabbit, Qodo, Gemini, Greptile)
8. Fix review feedback iteratively
9. Test in real environments (not just localhost)

**Phase 4: Documentation**
10. Document as you go (update CURRENT_STATUS.md)
11. Write for future you (troubleshooting guides)

**Phase 5: Security**
12. Think like an attacker (adversarial scenarios)
13. Security testing (attack scenario test cases)

**Phase 6: Production**
14. Error message quality (actionable, helpful)
15. Observability (logging, metrics, monitoring)
