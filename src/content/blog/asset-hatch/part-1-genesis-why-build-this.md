**The Setup:** December 24, 2025, 10:47 AM. Chatting with Opus in the Claude Desktop app, the plan on the table felt bare, so I toss up the trusty ol’ [Claude](http://www.claude.ai) and threw the bare idea down. Enjoy the typos!

Lets rewind a bit, here’s how I decided on this idea:

## The Problem:

For months, the goal was simple: ship small games using AI agents like Gemini and Claude Code. The agents could scaffold systems, wire up logic, and get a playable prototype on screen in hours. The real friction wasn’t that AI art was impossible—it was that there was no scaffolding or workflow to make generating a full set of usable assets *easy*.

### The Pattern

Here's what would happen almost every time:

```plaintext
Me: "Let's add some character sprites for the player."  
Claude: "I can help you set up the sprite system. You'll need to:  
  1. Create placeholder rectangles for now  
  2. Find sprites from itch.io or OpenGameArt  
  3. Download them and add them to /public/sprites/."  

Me: "Can't you just generate them?"  

Claude: "I can generate individual images, 
but I don't have a built-in workflow to plan, generate, 
and wire up a whole asset pack for you."
```

And that was it. Momentum gone. The project stalled because the “last mile” between idea and shippable assets was still manual.

## Where Asset Hatch was … hatched

AI coding agents are phenomenal at generating code, refactoring systems, writing tests, and debugging edge cases. But when it came to assets, there was no opinionated pipeline: no place where you could describe a game, get a structured asset plan, and then walk out with a full pack ready to drop into a project.

What was missing wasn’t just better images; it was:

* A way to enumerate everything the game would need
    
* A single flow that took you from “idea” to “assets + manifests”
    
* A tool built around game concepts like sprite sheets, tilesets, and animation sets
    

This realization led me down the 11 day, dusk till dawn, expedition which led to the writing of this blog.

### The Deeper Issue

Game assets aren't just individual images. They're a **system**. A character isn't one sprite; it's:

* Idle animation (4 frames)
    
* Walk cycle (8 frames)
    
* Attack animation (6 frames)
    
* Multiple directions (north, south, east, west)
    
* Consistent proportions across all of them
    
* Matching color palette
    
* Same art style throughout
    

When you ask an AI coding agent to generate these, it treats each request independently. You end up with a Frankenstein's monster of visual styles that no amount of clever prompting can fix.

## The Solution: Leveraging style retention

I realized I could apply a known concept: **style retention**. But I needed to adapt it for a conversational agent workflow and tailor the output to work well with AI Agents and AAA game development workflows.

> "Flux.2 can use reference images to maintain style consistency across generations. Including a style anchor image in your request ensures all outputs match the aesthetic."

**Style anchor image.** This was the key to applying image style retention in this context.

### The Mental Model Shift

What if you separated the asset creation workflow into phases?

**Phase 1: Planning** — Describe your game, let an AI agent (Asset-Hatch) build a complete asset list.

**Phase 2: Style Anchoring** — Upload (or generate) ONE reference image that defines the visual style.

**Phase 3: Generation** — Generate ALL assets using the style anchor.

**Phase 4: Export** — Package everything with manifest files.

Suddenly, the consistency problem had a solution: **persistent visual context across all generations**.

## Why Build It?

Legitimate question. Doesn't this already exist?

Short answer: No. Longer answer: Sort of, but not really.

**Existing tools:**

* **General image generators** (Midjourney, DALL-E) — Great for one-offs, terrible for asset packs
    
* **Game asset marketplaces** ([itch.io](http://itch.io), Unity Asset Store) — Pre-made assets, not custom to your game
    
* **Pixel art tools** (Aseprite, Piskel) — Require artistic skill I don't have
    
* **AI art tools** ([Leonardo.ai](http://Leonardo.ai), Scenario) — No project memory, no agent integration

* **Nano Banana** ([Gemini 2.5 Flash Image](https://aistudio.google.com/models/gemini-2-5-flash-image)) — Incredible for generating assets, but needs scaffolding to make generating many and keeping them anchored in style.
    

What didn't exist was a tool that:

1. **Understood games** — Knows what a sprite sheet is, how tilesets work
    
2. **Maintained consistency** — Style anchors, character registries, color palettes
    
3. **Worked conversationally** — Natural language, not complex forms
    
4. **Exported for AI agents** — Manifest files that Claude Code can actually use
    

## The Constraints

I'm a solo developer with a full-time job. I don't have months. I don't have funding. I don't have a team.

What I do have:

* Claude Code (ironic, given the problem I'm solving)
    
* 3-4 hours per evening
    
* A stubbornness about shipping things
    

**Constraint #1: Speed over perfection** MVP in 6-8 weeks or it doesn't happen. No gold-plating, no "nice to haves."

**Constraint #2: Open source from day one** If I'm solving my own problem, others have it too. Public repo, MIT license, community-driven.

**Constraint #3: AI-first development** Use Claude Code to build a tool for Claude Code users. Meta, but intentional.

**Constraint #4: Portfolio quality** This needs to be good enough to show employers/investors. No sloppy code, no hacks that accumulate debt.

## The Tech Stack Decision

Here's what I landed on (after reading way too much documentation):

### Frontend

* **Next.js 15** — App Router, React Server Components, Turbopack
    
* **TypeScript** — Type safety is non-negotiable for solo dev
    
* **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** — Fast styling without CSS hell
    

### AI Integration

* **<s>CopilotKit</s>** — (This decision doesn't age well—stay tuned for Part 3)
    
* **OpenRouter** — Model aggregator (Gemini, Flux.2, GPT, Claude, etc.)
    
* **Gemini 3 Pro** — [Planning agent](https://gemini.google.com/app) (tool calling, fast, cheap)
    
* **Flux.2 Dev** — Image generation (best prompt adherence I've found)
    

### Data Layer

* **IndexedDB (Dexie)** — Client-side database, 50MB limit
    
* **Local storage first** — No server until absolutely necessary
    
* **Future: Vercel Postgres** — When scaling requires it
    

### Why These Choices?

**Next.js 15:** React Server Components + streaming feel like magic for AI responses. Also, Vercel makes deployment trivial.

**CopilotKit:** (Narrator: This was a mistake.) Promised "AI agents in 5 minutes" with tool calling built-in. Seemed perfect for conversational planning.

**OpenRouter:** One API for every model. When Flux.2 gets too expensive or Gemini hits rate limits, I can swap models without rewriting code.

**Dexie/IndexedDB:** Users can have 2-3 active projects (~15-30MB each with image compression). Local-first means instant loads, no server costs during development.

## The Original Vision

I didn't sketch this on a napkin. I had Opus in the Claude Desktop app handle the planning for the original vision. Here's how I envisioned the conversation flow:

```markdown
User: "I'm building a cozy farming game"
  ↓
Agent: "Great! I'll set up a farming simulator project.
        What art style? Pixel art, low poly, hand-drawn?"
  ↓
User: "Pixel art, top-down view"
  ↓
Agent: [Calls updateQuality tool]
       [Calls addEntityToPlan tool]
       "I've started your plan. Let's define characters.
        Do you want a male farmer, female, or both?"
  ↓
[Conversation continues...]
  ↓
Agent: [Calls markPlanComplete tool]
       "Your plan has 47 assets. Ready to set the style?"
  ↓
User: [Uploads reference image of pixel art style they like]
  ↓
System: [Analyzes image]
        [Extracts color palette]
        "Style locked. Generating 47 assets..."
  ↓
[20 minutes later]
  ↓
System: "Complete. Download asset-pack.zip"
```

**One conversation. One reference image. Complete, consistent asset pack.**

That was the dream.

## The Reality Check

Before writing a single line of code, I asked myself the hard questions:

**Q: Will anyone actually use this?** A: I will. That's enough for v1. If it solves my problem, it probably solves others'.

**Q: Can you actually build this solo?** A: With AI assistance and ruthless scope control, yes. 6-8 weeks is tight but doable.

**Q: What if Flux.2 isn't good enough for consistent sprites?** A: Then we learn that in Week 4's validation gate. Fail fast, pivot if needed.

**Q: Why not just use existing tools?** A: Because none of them solve the **system problem**—they generate images, not asset packs.

## The Commit That Started It All

```bash
commit eb75c74
Author: zenchantlive
Date: Tue Dec 24 2025

Initial commit from Create Next App
```

60 lines. Default Next.js boilerplate. Nothing special.

But every journey starts with `npm run dev`.

## What's Next

In [Part 2](part-2-first-contact-building-with-ai.md), we'll go from empty repo to working chat interface in 24 hours. You'll see:

* The slice-based development approach (ship features, not components)
    
* How I integrated CopilotKit (and why it seemed like a great idea at the time)
    
* The cosmic glassmorphism UI that became Asset Hatch's aesthetic
    
* The memory system that prevents AI session amnesia
    

But here's a preview: by the end of Day 2, I had a beautiful chat interface that couldn't actually execute tools. The AI would talk *about* updating the plan, but nothing would happen.

That bug would haunt me for the next 48 hours.
