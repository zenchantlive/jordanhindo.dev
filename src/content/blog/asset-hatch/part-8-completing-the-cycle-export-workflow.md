**Previously:** Hardened the API and secured the data layer. The generation engine is producing beautiful, consistent assets.

**Now:** We solve the final problem: getting those assets out of the app and into the user's game engine.

Building an AI generation tool is fun, but if the output is just a bunch of "Image\_1.png", "Image\_2.png" files in a browser library, it’s not a tool—it’s a toy. To make Asset Hatch a professional utility, we needed a robust export pipeline.

## The Strategy: Single-Asset Extraction ([ADR-014](https://github.com/zenchantlive/Asset-Hatch/blob/main/src/memory/adr/014-asset-extraction-strategy.md))

Early in the project, I considered generating "sheets" of assets. However, as documented in **ADR-014**, we pivoted to a **Single-Asset Generation Strategy**.

### Why Single-Asset?

1. **Precision:** Flux.2 handles a single subject far better than a complex grid of 16 items.
    
2. **Post-Processing:** It's easier to remove backgrounds and upscale individual objects.
    
3. **Semantic Control:** Each generation is tied to a specific requirement (e.g., "Main Character - Walk Cycle - Frame 1").
    

### The Prompt Engineering Fix

To prevent the "showroom" effect (where AI generates furniture in a room instead of a standalone sprite), we updated our templates with strict isolation keywords:

```typescript
// lib/prompt-templates.ts
export const buildCharacterSpritePrompt = (desc: string) => `
  ${desc}, 
  single isolated object, 
  centered on transparent background, 
  no other objects in scene, 
  professional game asset sprite...
`;
```

## Engineering the Export Pipeline

The export process happens in three stages:

### 1\. Semantic ID Generation

We don't want `7b3f-2a1c.png`. We want `hero_knight_idle_01.png`. We implemented a semantic ID generator that pulls from the original request parameters to ensure the exported ZIP is immediately organized for the developer.

### 2\. ZIP Packaging (Client-Side + API)

We built an export endpoint that aggregates all "Approved" assets for a project.

```typescript
// app/api/export/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { projectId, assetIds } = await req.json();
  const assets = await prisma.generatedAsset.findMany({
    where: { id: { in: assetIds }, projectId }
  });

  // Fetch blobs from Dexie (client side) or storage (server side)
  // Packaging them into a single archive...
}
```

### 3\. ZIP Streaming

To handle large asset packs (20+ high-res pngs), we implemented a streaming ZIP download. This avoids memory spikes on the server and provides an "instant start" feel for the user.

## The UX: The Export Panel

The final piece of the UI puzzle was the `ExportPanel`. It’s a dedicated mode that:

* Summarizes the total asset count.
    
* Shows a preview of the ZIP structure.
    
* Provides a one-click "Download Package" button.

## What Completing the Loop Taught Me

**1\. The "Last Mile" is the Hardest** Generating an image takes 20 seconds. Building the infrastructure to name, package, and deliver that image takes 2 days. Don't underestimate the delivery layer.

**2\. ADRs are Legal Records for Future You** ADR-014 was critical. When I felt the urge to go back to sprite sheets, I re-read the trade-off analysis and realized why I chose single-assets. It kept the project on track.

**3\. Tool Design is DX (Developer Experience)** Asset Hatch is built for developers. Helping them by automatically naming files and organizing folders isn't "polish"—it's a core feature.

## Coming Next

In Part 9: V2.1 - The UI Layer and The Split Brain, we look at how a simple "UI tweak" turned into an architectural overhaul.
